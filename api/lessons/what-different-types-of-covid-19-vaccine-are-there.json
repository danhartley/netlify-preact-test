      "definition": "A harmless virus is altered by introducing part of the disease-causing virus’ genetic code, such as the code for Covid-19’s ‘spike’ protein.   The harmless virus transports the code into our cells which then start to produce the protein.  This triggers an immune response, priming our immune system to attack the real virus later.",
